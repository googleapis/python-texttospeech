    Configuration to set up audio encoder. The encoding determines the output

      AUDIO_ENCODING_UNSPECIFIED (int): Not specified. Will return result
      ``google.rpc.Code.INVALID_ARGUMENT``.
      LINEAR16 (int): Uncompressed 16-bit signed little-endian samples (Linear PCM).
      Audio content returned as LINEAR16 also contains a WAV header.
      MP3 (int): MP3 audio at 32kbps.
      OGG_OPUS (int): Opus encoded audio wrapped in an ogg container. The result will be a
      file which can be played natively on Android, and in browsers (at least
      Chrome and Firefox). The quality of the encoding is considerably higher
      than MP3 while using approximately the same bitrate.
